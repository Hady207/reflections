well first dif helped in identifying and knowing the mistakes that can happen in the code
FC in the command promt will help know all the mistakes that happens

version controll allows me to add entire new feature in a code and if im not happy with the 
viersion of code i can go back to the pervious version.

adding a manuel commit gives a great felxiablity but also we need to time the commits right
so its not too big or too small. 

want to see the diffrence between two things use git diff 
first id commit is where we want to compare second id where we want to see the changes that 
happend from the previous file.
